# Transactional Call Logs using Advances in Databases

## Use Case

In today's data-driven environment, the ability to manage, analyze, and extract actionable insights from large volumes of data is critical for businesses to remain competitive. This project focuses on developing a robust data warehousing solution tailored to effectively manage and analyze customer, plan, date, and call-related data. By leveraging advanced data warehousing techniques, the solution provides a unified platform for efficient data storage, retrieval, and analysis, enabling businesses to make informed decisions and enhance operational efficiency.
The data warehouse is designed with key dimensions such as customers, plans, dates, and calls, which are interconnected using foreign keys (cust_id, plan_id, date_id). These relationships form the foundation for creating a star schema, ensuring optimal query performance and simplified data analysis. The cust_id uniquely identifies customer information, while plan_id and date_id link to plan and temporal data, respectively, enabling comprehensive insights into customer behavior, plan performance, and call patterns over time.
